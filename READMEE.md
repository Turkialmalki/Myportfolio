# Ruby on Rails Portfolio Website


This project is for web developers who seeking a job and want a simple portfolio online, and have a basic understanding of the Ruby on Rails framework.

It has five major sections...

# About me

This is a plain static page you can modify at app/views/pages/index.html.erb

# Summary 

This is a summary of your 'eduaction, experience, skills and achievement. Along with the Hover feature  

# Projects

This is a simple CRUD where you can log in through visiting /users/sign_in and start creating,
updating and deleting your projects online. Each project has a title, subtitle, description, cover and associated captioned screenshots.

# Contact

This is a simple contact form, it sends emails directly saving them in the DB.

This is a lovingly hand-coded open-source branch of my own portfolio website, so please feel free to modify it, 
add your own styles and drop me a link once it's done! :) It will be very much appreciated... Enjoy!

# Resume Tips

Here's my thoughts about how to approach a job in a simple way.


# Images/Multimedia
www.unsplash.com was a good website providing free to use images. I chose an image which fitted the colour scheme.

### Layout Design
Designing the layout was quite a challenging process as I had limited experience with designing a whole website by myself. It was very helpful to browse through other developers' portfolios and other websites providing free layouts such as www.startbootstrap.com for inspiration.
